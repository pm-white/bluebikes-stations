# bluebikes-stations
A simple webpage that shows a map of [Bluebikes](https://bluebikes.com/) stations, including real-time bike and dock availability. Station info comes from [Bluebike's GBFS feed](https://gbfs.bluebikes.com/gbfs/gbfs.json). The map is a [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map. 

This is not meant to replace or supplement the official [system map](https://account.bluebikes.com/map), it's just an opportunity for me to practice web development.

View the map [here](https://pm-white.github.io/bluebikes-stations/).
